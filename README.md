This is only set up for development right now as I'm sure this skill won't be published ever. I just really didn't want to buy another music subscription. 
## Setup Instructions: ##
(These were written from a linux install but I assume that it is similar for other platforms.)

### Things you'll need to install / have before setup: ###

<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Python 3 </a> (the latest should work)

<a href="https://ngrok.com/download" target="_blank">Ngrok </a> (secure tunneling over localhost)
A Google Play Subscription (haven't tested free accounts with this yet)
<br>
Echo Dot
<br>
<a href="https://www.howtoforge.com/linux_screen" target="_blank">Screen </a> (This isn't necessary but makes it easier to keep the program running when you log off of your ssh session on linux.)
